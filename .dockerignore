# .dockerignore - Excludes files and directories from Docker build context
# This file works similarly to .gitignore but for Docker builds
# Files listed here won't be sent to the Docker daemon during build
# This reduces build context size and improves build performance

# Git version control files
# These aren't needed in the container and can contain sensitive history
